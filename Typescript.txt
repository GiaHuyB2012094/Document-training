1.what is typescript ?
ts is a statically-typed superset of js that adds optional static typing to the language. allow dev to write
js code with type annotations, used lager-scale projects.

2.why use ts?
- static typing: ts allows dev to specify types for variables, func parameters, return value, and more. this 
helps catch errors during dev, such as type mismatches before runtime.
- code maintainability: with type annotations, ts code easier to understand, improve code maintainability, especially
in larger project or when working in teams.
- IDE Support: providing features like code completion, type checking and refactoring tools.
- Tooling: ts integrates
- Compatibility: js code valid is also valid ts code
- Enhanced Features: interfaces, enums, generics, and more.These features can improve code structure, readability, 
and maintainability.

3.ts
- annotation
- type interface
- any type
- func parameter
- func return annotaiton
- void func
- object, arr
- type alias -> declare multiple varibale have type in TYPE
- optional property
- intersection types -> combine type alias
- unions -> a variable have multiple type
- literal types	-> a variable have multiple value
- tuples
- enums
- class properties Annotations
- access modifiers 
	+ public
	+ private
	+ protected
- getters & setters
	+ get -> return value
	+ set -> setting value for variable

- interface -> used to define the tructure of object, func and classes.
-> implements with class
+ declaration merging

- generics 
- type narrowing
	+ type guards -> typeof
	+ the instanceof operator
	+ intersection types
- setup of ts
	+ tsc -init
